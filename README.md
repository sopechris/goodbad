## 🌍 Why This Matters

Ethical AI shouldn't just reflect one worldview — it should help us understand **many**. By drawing from centuries of philosophy, religion, and psychology, this project aims to:

- Create space for **comparative moral reasoning**
- Ground responses in **transparent sources**
- Offer a **thoughtful tool** for anyone navigating ethical decisions

Whether you're a student of ethics, a curious thinker, or someone who just wants to understand what "good" really means — you're welcome here.
