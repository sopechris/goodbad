# goodbad
the good and the bad, not ugly
I want to start this project from scratch; I don't even know if it already exists, but I think it's necessary.
Spiritual goodness ofter comes from what we do, our own decisions, and this tool will give you perspective on a lot of topics from different spiritual viewpoints.  
Just need to describe a scenario and this tool will do everything for you.
