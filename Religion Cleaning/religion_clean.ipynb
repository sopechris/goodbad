Others are perhaps more interesting - the appearance of 'animal' in Aristotle, for example. And yet others are just artifacts of the texts we had available - the word 'madness' is common in Continental philosophy because of Foucault's book *History of Madness*. That said, some of these are comical as well. For example, analytic philosophy's tendency to logical formalism led to it having variables for propositions ('p' and 'x') among its most commonly used words.\n",

        "Not bad! These bigrams actually give a solid sense of the key concepts of some of the schools. Rationalism's emphasis on 'clear and distinct ideas' and empiricism's focus on 'simple and complex ideas' are so forceful that both singular and plural versions of the phrases show up. Heidegger's common phrase 'always already' finds itself on the Phenomenology bigram list, and the German Idealist's continual discussion of self-consciousness is also evident. Aristotle and Plato's bigrams are harder to interpret, with Plato's being mostly common locutions from the dialogues rather than anything philosophically significant."

        "\n",
        "All the previous explorations were done with some basic cleaning methods like removing stopwords. And while we brushed over it thus far, in the process of dealing with the data we encountered a lot of oddities. These include\n",
        "- words fused together (e.g., 'aconcept' for 'a concept')\n",
        "- headers of pages occurring repeatedly in the text\n",
        "- page numbers and citation numbers\n",
        "- footnotes, roman numerals, titles of chapters\n",
        "\n",
        "All these would need to be removed if we are to train a model on the actual content of these thinkers, and especially if we want a neural network to do any kind of predictive work where it will look at full sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of dealing with these and getting the data ready for our models has a few steps:\n",
        "1. develop a general cleaning function that can work for every text (removing roman numerals, for example)\n",
        "2. examine each text itself and remove the specific headers that are relevant to it\n",
        "  - look for features that could capture all the footnotes here as well\n",
        "3. tokenize the text using spacy\n",
        "4. examine the tokens for unusual patterns\n",
        "  - there should be virtually no duplicate sentences\n",
        "  - we can remove sentences that are too short to mean anything\n",
        "  - remove sentences that contain terms that must be from footnotes (the author's name should be very rare in the actual text, for example)\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately many of these steps can only be done ad hoc; there is no real way to know whether and what headers are in a text without examining the files individually. So the process is a bit tedious and time-consuming. Still, when we finish we will have data that is much cleaner and more useful for modeling.\n"
